But even though it saves you space, it limits your access when away from the internet. This program lacks features like clone brushes and smart selectors. But you will find sliders covering an array of adjustments. Applying tints, adding vignettes, sharpening, and adjusting brightness are just a few things you can do. You also have limited access to templates, images, and storage. That means you can only edit JPEGs, PNGs, and TIFFs, and they need to be under 16MB each. So you need to convert your RAW file images before using this free photo editor. Even with a scaled-back version, you get many editing features you expect from Adobe, like masks and even the Liquify tool. What we find interesting is the Pop Color tool. It allows you to change the hue of any image quickly. And we like to use the Fill Light tool to boost lighting conditions for any photos that fall short. Importing images is simple. This software also allows you to edit each image individually. You make manual adjustments via a few sliders, which are enough for most of your edits. The program includes a single-click optimization tool. This tool works well for landscapes, but it falls short for portraits. Also, when you edit a photo, you can’t apply the changes across a set of pictures in one go. That means you are not limited to any browser and there are no unnecessary downloads on your end. On top of that, sharpening and blurring your images is a breeze. A few of them are RAW conversion, brushes, filters, and clone stamps. It allows you to work intuitively with one-click filters and image-enhancing tools. This top-quality editor also features advanced editing tools for adjusting tone curves and levels. It comes with brushes, layers, and layer masks for advanced edits. Other features include selection tools, gradients, object removal, and RAW file support. The one limitation of Photo Pos Pro is that it only allows you to export at a maximum image size of 1024 x 1024 px. But it’s still a fantastic option to create smaller files. This app might seem basic, but it allows photographers to achieve professional results. And you can find all your edits in the image’s history, letting you undo or redo modifications at any time. There is also a background remover, textures, and portrait touch-up tools. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support RAW files. You can also access it as a Chrome extension to edit your Google photos. It also comes with plenty of visual effects. But some of them are watermarked. Fotor’s free photo software reduces file sizes to 4000px on the long edge. This resolution is something most photography enthusiasts won’t have a problem with. The best thing about Fotor is that you can run it through your browser instead of taking up space on your hard drive. But remember to use Fotor on Google Chrome rather than Safari. Some of the adjustments are limited while using Safari. Fotor has apps available for Windows, macOS, Android, and iPhone. There’s no need to use advanced software when all your image requires is a crop. A few of them are layers, filters, and plugins created by their enthusiastic community. You will also notice a great 3D rotation and zoom function. Amateur Photographer

        Best photo editing software in 2025 for beginners and pros

        Take your photos to the next level with these image editing programs. Jon Stapley Follow @j_stapling

          Photo editing with Apple Mac Studio and Studio Display. A good edit can bring a flat photograph to life, whether through a judicious crop to bring focus to the main subject; tuning colours to give them punch; or even a transformation such as a full black-and-white conversion. After that comes the best free photo-editing software choices, finishing off with the best photo editing app for mobile. We reviewed the most recent version of Adobe Photoshop, and its ability to clean up and declutter images has been made faster than ever thanks to new AI-powered object selection tools. Newer versions of Photoshop have come loaded with powerful generative AI tools such as Generative Fill and Generative Expand, which allow you to radically transform images with generative content. These allow you to use keywording and rating to organise your images and single out the keepers. If you’re regularly sifting through large numbers of files, it is an enormous timesaver. Its image-repair and enhancement tools are precise and intuitive, and the highly fine-tunable masking function can be immensely useful. You can also easily copy your changes to multiple images for speedy batch editing. And for more advice, check out our guide to the pros and cons of RAW vs JPEG. The program includes plenty of camera and lens correction profiles too, with the option to upload more if needed. ZPS X doesn’t have Adobe’s ultra-advanced features like Neural Filters, and its corrections aren’t as good as those you’d find in the likes of Photoshop or DxO PhotoLab. You can also create so-called ‘Sessions’: standalone projects that are streamlined to include only the current photos you are working on, making it free of distractions. However, after finishing with a session, there is an option to import it into your CaptureOne catalogue and apply further editing, too. Providing an excellent RAW processing performance and comprehensive support for USB and wireless tethering (your shots are transported to your computer in real time, where you can apply edits while you shoot), it became a must-have for many professional studio photographers. Even though it’s compatible with over 450 camera models, it only supports tethered capture for Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Leica, Sigma and Phase One/Mamiya. We’ve been really impressed by Affinity Photo 2, even if it is tricky to get to grips with at first. One thing we particularly appreciated in our review was getting our heads around the adjustment presets, which let you save and re-use your favourite adjustments – a real time-saver for batch-editing. Read our full Affinity Photo 2 review. Best for RAW

            Best RAW processor: DxO PhotoLab 8

                  Amateur Photographer verdict

                  For rescuing detail in raw files, DxO’s de-noising technologies are unmatched. DxO PhotoLab 8 also offers an ever growing list of lens correction profiles
                      Pros
                        * Extremely powerful noise reduction
                        * Lots of correction profiles

            This powerful software from DxO is especially potent for processing raw files. DxO’s de-noising technologies, DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD2S, provide huge benefits in terms of rescuing detail in shots that are suffering from a significant amount of digital noise due to being shot at high ISOs. The process is fast and highly effective, able to turn shots you might have written off as irredeemable into something you can make prints from. If you’re using an older camera that gets noisy very quickly when the ISO is turned up, PhotoLab could help extend its lease of life. When we reviewed PhotoLab 8 we were hugely impressed – the newly added hue mask and improved lens softness compensation, along with a new version of DeepPRIME XD2S niose reduction feature, work better than ever. The long-awaited luminosity mask and also a compare tool similar to the one seen in Lightroom have been added too. LUTs (Colour Lookup tables) are colour filters invaluable for video editors. DxO Photolab 8 includes 17 initial choices, but it also supports third-party LUTs as well. This tool is used increasingly among photographers, as it helps speed up their workflow through automatic colour correction and colour grading. Read more about the DxO PhotoLab 8

              Image: RawTherapee

                  Amateur Photographer verdict

                  The kind of software for people who love geeking out over the technical nuances of raw processing – RawTherapee can be intimidating to novices, but it’s a powerful tool that’s 100% free. Pros
                        * Completely free
                        * Tons of options for processing raws
                      Cons
                        * Overwhelming interface
                        * Slow pace of updates

            Type        Raw conversion software    
            Pricing     Free

            Website     rawtherapee.com            
            

            When you first boot up RawTherapee, you might be a little overwhelmed at the complexity of what you’re looking at. We’ve found that this free raw conversion software is not blessed with the most intuitive of interfaces, with tons of tool panels and a huge array of features. Bear in mind that updates for the software have slowed in recent years, with the last one coming in November 2022 – so if you have a newer camera, the software won’t have specific profiles for it. Best mobile image editing software

            Finally, we’re taking a quick look at the best apps for editing photos on the go. Most photographers likely snap plenty of pics on their phone as well as their camera, and there are plenty of apps out there to help you kick your smartphone photography game up a notch. We have a whole dedicated guide to the best photo apps for phones, including editing apps – but read on for our top recommendation. Best for mobile

            Best image editing app: Snapseed

              Snapseed’s interface is brilliantly designed for use on touchscreen devices. Photo credit: Andy Westlake

                  Amateur Photographer verdict

                  An app favoured by photographers around the world, Snapseed is definitely the best choice for mobile editors – and, somehow, it’s completely free to use! Pros
                        * Free to use, no strings
                        * Advanced adjustment options
                        * Useful presets
                      Cons
                        * Slightly complex interface (but you’ll get used to it)

            Pricing     Free                   
            Platforms   iOS and Android        
            User level  Beginner               
            Website     Google Play / App Store
            

            We regard Snapseed as one of the top choices for photo editors on mobile – while there are plenty of competitors out there, truthfully you’re unlikely to go wrong with Snapseed. A completely free, Google-made app, available for both iPhones and Android devices, Snapseed puts a powerful and intuitive editor in the palm of your hand. As well as standard tools like cropping and rotating images, Snapseed also enables Curves adjustments, with a range of presets available to make things easier. Read our guide to how to edit your photos in Snapseed. System requirements

            You will need sufficient horsepower to run the latest editing software, so if your computer is somewhat outdated, this can be an issue. Check on the manufacturer’s website for the recommended RAM, graphics card size and type, operating system and monitor resolution recommendations. For example, Photoshop’s system requirements state 16 GB as recommended; however, you can get away with the minimum 8GB, but speed and performance may be curbed. Get as much RAM as you can afford, ideally 16GB or more

            Consider whether you have enough hard disk space to run it. I am not talking about space to install the software, but having enough free hard disk space to run it. These often include shiny new features like Photoshops’ Generative AI but can be other useful things like support for newly released cameras and lens profile corrections. Workflow and organisation

            Would you like to edit as well as catalogue your images? It is easy to shoot in burst and fill up your hard drives, so it is more and more important to be able to easily locate your files. You might want built-in filters or presets that can be easily applied for a quick fix, AI editing features, or generative fill. Or maybe you want to work on different layers to composite multiple images together. If you edit your images one by one, practically any of the editors will suit you; however, if your work requires editing multiple images with similar changes, like in event or wedding photography, then you want to make sure batch editing is included in the features. For macro or product photography, software that’s capable of compiling focus-stacked photos will be essential; but for someone who shoots wildlife, effective noise reduction will be a lifesaver. Choose three images and edit them in each program; this way you can compare the ease of use and features and get a good idea if you will be comfortable using it on the long run.

          When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. We found this photo editing toolkit to be breathtaking. It features layers, masks, curves, and levels. You can eliminate flaws easily with the excellent clone stamp and healing tools, create custom brushes, apply perspective changes, and apply changes to isolated areas with smart selection tools. Importing pictures is a breeze, and once they've been added to the pool, you can select several at once to rotate or mirror, saving you valuable time. You can also choose individual photos to enhance with the software's one-click optimization tool. If you want to make manual color and exposure corrections, there are half a dozen sliders to let you do exactly that. It's a shame you can't also apply the same color changes to a whole set of pictures at once, but this is otherwise a brilliant free photo editor for making quick corrections. You won't find advanced tools like clone brushes and smart selectors here. But there's a set of handy sliders for applying tints, vignette effects, sharpening, adjusting brightness, saturation and contrast, and much more. If there's a specific area of retouching you need to do with the clone brush or healing tool for example, you're out of luck. However, if your needs are simple, its stack of high-end filters really shine. Popular Content

          f-stop Dyota Camera Backpack Review for 2024

          Read Article There's a foolproof tilt-shift tool, for example, and a raft of vintage and vibrant color tweaks, all easily accessed through Fotor's clever menu system. You can manually alter your own curves and levels, too, but without the complexity of high-end tools. Feed it a pile of pics and it'll filter the lot of them in one go, perfect if you have a memory card full of holiday snaps and need to cover up the results of a dodgy camera or shaky hand. If it's still too intimidating, there's also an optional 'novice' layout that resembles Fotor's filter-based approach. The 'expert' layout offers both layers and layer masks for sophisticated editing, as well as tools for adjusting curves and levels manually. You can still access the one-click filters via the main menu, but the focus is much more on fine editing. It's a shame that the free version of Photo Pos Pro only allows you to export at a maximum of 1,024 x 1,024 pixels. If you're preparing images to share online this might not be a problem, but it limits the software's usefulness if you want to print your work. Read our full Paint.NET review

            Best free photo editor for RAW files

            (Image credit: Shutterstock; MOOII Tech; Unsplash)

                7. The meat, of course, is in the photo editing here. PhotoScape's filters are pretty advanced, so it's if good choice if you need to quickly level, sharpen or add mild filtering to pictures in a snap. We'd call this a great choice, whether you want a quick way to fine-tune your photos or have some advanced tasks to tackle. Its only drawbacks are the limits on uploaded file size and types, and the lack of support for layers. If you simply want to make a few adjustments (removing blemishes and improving colors, for example) then a simple online tool might be perfect, doing the job well without overwhelming you with options. If, on the other hand, you're interested in more advanced editing then you'll want to focus on desktop software that offers tools such as layers and masks, giving you full control over the process.

The most important factor is that these adjustments are accurate and up to a high standard. Believable edits will mimic how light and color can change inside the camera through different exposures, film types, or other color management. If you can’t do a photo edit with GIMP, you probably can’t do it anywhere. The toolkit is full of great features like layers, masks, curves, and levels. And there are Clone Stamp and Healing tools to fix blemishes. The software even allows you to apply changes to isolated areas. The single-window mode lays out the toolbars and canvas in an Adobe-style layout. There is a massive array of plugins to get the best out of your image. You can use it for both simple adjustments and professional editing. You can import your images into the program via a database. You can then use non-destructive tools to get the most from your pictures. You are not restricted to JPEG images. You can quickly and automatically convert RAW files. For example, Darktable offers lens and perspective corrections. RawTherapee
